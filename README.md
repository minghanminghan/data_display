## About this App

This React app is built to visualize multi-channel time series data using a live line chart.\
It uses Javascript's FileReader and Canvas APIs to parse and render data from uploaded csv files.\
It was designed to support a 128-channel device and can play incoming data at 75 frames per second.\
The user has control over basic display elements such as the chart dimensions, playback speed, and line color.\
Currently the core logic behind the app is sound, but there are some optimizations and bug fixes to be made.\

Some next steps for the project include:
1) Fix displayIndex bug which causes the current chunk to unload
2) Increase Canvas render speed to support higher frame rates
3) Optimize read operations by reading from .bin instead of .csv
4) Reduce the number of hooks used by each component
5) Integrate Javascript's WebSocket API to enable live data streaming

## Creating test cases
Running randomData.py will by default create a 32 gb test file called '32gb.csv' .\
By changing the 'samplesPerPack' and 'numOfPacks' variable, users can customize the file size.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
